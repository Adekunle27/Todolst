# Todolst
A small tasks management system

## Quick Overview

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adenekan41/exquis-app
cd exquis-app
cd client && npm install
cd server && npm install 
cd client && npm start
cd server && npm start
```
If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Start the project, and you’re good to go.
